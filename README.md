## Installation & Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <repository-url> e-expert
cd e-expert
```

### 2. Automated Setup (Quick Start)

You can run Composer's automated setup script which installs dependencies, creates the `.env` file, generates the application key, runs migrations, and builds frontend assets:

```bash
composer run setup
```

---

### 3. Manual Step-by-Step Installation

If you prefer to configure each step manually:

#### A. Install PHP & JavaScript Dependencies

```bash
composer install
npm install
```

#### B. Configure Environment

Copy the example environment file and generate the application encryption key:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
php artisan key:generate
```

Configure your database connection in `.env`:

```ini
DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=Wakeel
DB_USERNAME=root
DB_PASSWORD=
```

#### C. Run Database Migrations & Seeders

```bash
php artisan migrate --seed
```

To seed comprehensive production baseline roles, permissions, and test data:

```bash
php artisan db:seed --class=ProductionDatabaseSeeder
```

#### D. Link Storage & Build Frontend Assets

```bash
php artisan storage:link
npm run build
```

## Releasing a New Version

Installations learn about new versions from the license server on their regular check-in (at most hourly, no cron job needed). Super admins then see an **Update available** banner and can update from **Settings → System Updates**. The updater checks out the release's git tag, runs `composer install`, migrates, refreshes permissions and clears caches, with the site in maintenance mode (administrators can still sign in).

To publish a release:

1. Rebuild and commit frontend assets if CSS/JS changed: `npm run build`.
2. Commit, then tag the commit and push the tag — the tag **is** the version, there is nothing to edit:

   ```bash
   git tag v1.2.0
   git push origin main --tags
   ```

3. The **Release** GitHub Action (`.github/workflows/release.yml`) turns the commit messages since the previous tag into release notes, creates the GitHub Release, and sends it to the license server, where it appears under **Releases** as **unpublished**. Review the notes there and tick **Published** to offer it to installations. (If the Action couldn't reach the license server, use **Sync from GitHub** on that page.)

   The Action needs, under the repository's Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions: the variable `LICENSE_SERVER_URL` and the secret `RELEASES_API_TOKEN` (same value as in the license server's `.env`). Push release tags one at a time — GitHub skips workflows for pushes of more than three tags.

An installation reports the highest `vX.Y.Z` tag on its checked-out commit (read from `.git`); `app_version` in `config/license.php` is only the fallback for an untagged checkout. Only publish once the tag is pushed: installations check out `v{version}` and stop with an error if it doesn't exist. The **Releases** list on the license server shows how many installations run each version.
