 * confirm page, POST is what actually decides the request. Outlook's Safe
 * Links (and equivalents) visit every link in a message to scan it, often
 * before the recipient opens it at all — a plain GET that mutated on the spot
 * meant the scanner itself approved or rejected requests before a human ever
