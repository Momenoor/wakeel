/**
 * Approve/reject a leave request from the email link itself, with no login.
 *
 * The `signed` route middleware is the only authentication — mirrors the
 * existing matter received-date accept/dispute flow. Because there is no form
 * behind either button, approving here always takes the whole request as one
 * block of whatever type the employee stated when filing (or annual leave, if
 * they didn't); anyone who needs a different split still has the full
 * approval modal in the panel.
 *
 * Each action is GET-to-confirm, POST-to-execute, on the very same signed URL
 * — never a plain GET that mutates. A bare GET that decides something the
 * instant it's requested is silently triggered by mail security scanners
 * (Outlook's Safe Links and equivalents visit every link in an email to check
 * it, often before the recipient ever opens the message), so a request would
 * get approved or rejected by a robot before anyone actually clicked. The GET
 * here only ever renders a page with one button; only the POST that button
 * submits changes anything.
