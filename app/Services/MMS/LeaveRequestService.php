/**
 * Approval and rejection of leave requests.
 *
 * The employee asks for days; the approver decides what those days ARE. That
 * division is the point of this class: an employee cannot see their own sick
 * ladder or annual balance, so asking them to classify their own absence would
 * be asking them to guess at a figure that determines their pay. The split
 * arrives here at approval time, from the approver.
 *
 * Approving is also what makes a request real to the rest of the app: it writes
 * rows into `party_leaves`, the ledger the incentive calculator already prorates
 * quotas from and the payroll engine counts unpaid days from. Neither of those
 * knows this workflow exists, which is the point — a request sitting in the
 * queue must have no effect on anyone's pay or quota until someone approves it.
