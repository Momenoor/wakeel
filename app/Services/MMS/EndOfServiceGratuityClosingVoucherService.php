/**
 * The annual EOSG closing journal voucher, generated and saved once a year at
 * 31/12 — not recomputed on the fly, unlike the monthly Salaries voucher.
 *
 * Every payroll run still computes and stores that month's gratuity accrual on
 * its payslips (`PayslipLine::EMPLOYER_COST`, via `PayrollService::accrueGratuity()`)
 * — the monthly figure stays accurate under mid-year salary changes because it is
 * a telescoping difference of cumulative entitlement. What this service does is
 * sum a calendar year's worth of those stored lines into one closing entry and
 * SAVE it (`EosgClosingVoucher` + `EosgClosingVoucherLine`), rather than the
 * monthly Salaries voucher (`PayrollJournalVoucherService`) posting a slice of
 * it every month.
 *
 *   Dr  Employer EOSG accrual expense   — itemised per employee
 *     Cr  EOSG provision (liability)    — the year's total, in one line
 *
 * Saving it is deliberate: once a year is closed, a payroll correction made
 * months later must not silently reshape what accounting already posted.
 * `generate()` is the only thing that changes the saved figures, and it
 * replaces the year's row and lines wholesale rather than patching them.
 *
 * An employee whose profile has `is_eosg_applicable` set to false never accrues
 * anything in the first place (`PayrollService::accrueGratuity()` returns 0 for
 * them), so excluding them again here is a defensive second check rather than
 * the only one.
 *
 * A year is only trusted to its monthly payslips when EVERY month that
 * employee was actually employed in has an EOSG payslip line — a partial year
 * (say, payroll only ran from August, or three months are missing because a
 * run was deleted) is not summed as-is, since that would silently understate
 * the year. Whenever coverage is incomplete — including a year with no
 * payslips at all, typically because the office had not yet started running
 * payroll through this system — `generate()` discards whatever partial figure
 * exists and falls back to a synthetic annual figure for exactly that
 * employee in exactly that year, computed the same way as a month's accrual
 * (`EndOfServiceGratuityService::accrualBetween()`, spanning the whole
 * calendar year instead of a month), using whichever basic salary was on
 * record at the year's end (`PayrollService::salaryAt()`). Nothing here
 * assumes the salary was constant for the whole year — only that the
 * year-end figure is the best available estimate when the monthly record is
 * missing or incomplete.
 *
 * An employee's `opening_eosg_balance` — gratuity entered once by HR/Finance
 * for service this system has no record of at all — is added on top of
 * whichever voucher is generated FIRST for that employee (checked by whether
 * any `EosgClosingVoucherLine` already exists for them in a different year),
 * never again after that. Which year counts as "first" is whichever is
 * generated first in practice, not necessarily the chronologically earliest —
 * the same one-time-top-up rule `LeaveEntitlementService` applies to an
 * opening leave balance.
 *
 * Every line also carries its OPENING and CLOSING cumulative balance, not
 * just the year's movement — a proper provision rollforward, not a bare
 * figure. Closing balance is always `opening + this year's movement`, and
 * opening balance is whichever year was generated immediately before this one
 * for that employee (its saved closing balance), chained year over year;
 * for whichever year is generated FIRST for an employee, there is no prior
 * year to chain from, so opening balance is computed fresh from their service
 * dates as of the day before the year began. This is what keeps "just this
 * year's amount" (the GL posting, unaffected by this) visibly reconciled
 * against the running total, and what makes a leaver's final year show
 * their true closing entitlement as of the date they actually left, not
 * 31/12.
