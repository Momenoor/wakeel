/**
 * The monthly Salaries journal voucher a payroll run posts to QuickBooks.
 *
 * There is no QuickBooks integration here and this does not pretend otherwise:
 * the office keys the entry in by hand, so what this produces is a balanced,
 * account-by-account sheet to copy from — not an API payload.
 *
 * The double entry it describes:
 *
 *   Dr  Basic salary, allowances, incentives   — the full cost of the month
 *   Dr  Bank fees                              — the fixed monthly transfer charge
 *     Cr  Loan and petty cash clearing         — advances recovered, per employee
 *     Cr  Unpaid leave recovery                — pay withheld, contra to expense
 *     Cr  Other salary deductions              — fines and manual adjustments
 *     Cr  Net salary payable                   — what the bank transfer settles,
 *                                                 the bank fee folded in
 *
 * Earnings are debited GROSS and the withholdings credited back, rather than
 * debiting the net figure. That is what makes the sheet reconcilable: the salary
 * expense line matches the payroll register, and every deduction can be traced
 * to the account it landed in.
 *
 * The bank fee is a fixed office-wide charge from Payroll Settings, not derived
 * from any payslip — it posts once per run regardless of headcount, because the
 * bank charges the same transfer fee whether the batch holds five salaries or
 * fifty. It debits its own expense account so the cost stays visible on the
 * expense side, but credits straight into Net Salary Payable rather than a
 * separate payable account — the office settles both in the one bank transfer,
 * so the liability side is one figure, not two.
 *
 * End-of-service gratuity is deliberately absent from this voucher. It is still
 * accrued and stored on every payslip (`PayslipLine::EMPLOYER_COST`, via
 * `PayrollService::accrueGratuity()`), but it is posted only once a year, as its
 * own closing entry, by `EndOfServiceGratuityClosingVoucherService` — mixing a
 * once-a-year provision into twelve monthly vouchers made it harder, not easier,
 * to reconcile either one.
