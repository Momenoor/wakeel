/**
 * End-of-service gratuity under Federal Decree-Law 33/2021, Article 51.
 *
 * Four things about the statute drive every method here:
 *
 * 1. It is computed on BASIC salary alone. Housing, transport and utilities are
 *    excluded, which is why nothing in this class ever sees a gross figure.
 * 2. Nothing is owed below one completed year of service (`minimumServiceYears()`,
 *    configurable if office policy or the law itself ever changes it); past
 *    that, the WHOLE period since joining is paid pro rata, not just the time
 *    since the threshold was crossed.
 * 3. The first five years are paid at 21/30 of basic pay per year. Every year
 *    beyond the fifth is paid at a full month's basic salary outright — taken
 *    as `$monthlyBasic` directly rather than "30 days at the daily rate", so it
 *    can never silently drift away from being one month's salary if
 *    `payroll_days_per_month` (shared with the unpaid-leave rate) is ever
 *    changed for an unrelated reason.
 * 4. A part-year is priced by calendar months and, for whatever is left over,
 *    the actual length of that specific calendar month — not by dividing raw
 *    elapsed days by 365. Measuring years as `days ÷ 365` and then differencing
 *    two such figures loses almost a full day every time (the "opening" and
 *    "closing" tallies each count their own reference date, so a full
 *    Jan-1-to-Dec-31 year comes out 364 days long, not 365 — a fencepost the
 *    month-based method below sidesteps entirely). The total is capped at two
 *    years' wage, so a very long tenure stops accruing rather than growing
 *    without limit.
