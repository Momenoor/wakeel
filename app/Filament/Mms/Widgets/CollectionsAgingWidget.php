/**
 * Outstanding balances bucketed by how long they have been owed.
 *
 * Nothing in the system computed aging before this — collection_status only
 * says paid / partial / unpaid, never "how overdue".
 *
 * Computed per MATTER, not per fee. On a commission matter the client's gross
 * payment is allocated to the revenue fee while the office-share line carries
 * the offsetting negative, so a per-fee view shows the revenue line as
 * over-collected and the deduction line as uncollected. Netting at matter level
 * makes those cancel, which is what actually happened:
 *
 *   owed     = SUM of every fee on the matter, signed — VAT adds, deduction
 *              lines subtract
 *   received = SUM of every allocation across those same fee lines
 *
 * Both sides must span the same fee lines. Counting only revenue fees as owed
 * while counting all allocations as received made every paid VAT or office-share
 * line look like over-collection of exactly its own amount.
 *
 * Each matter is aged by its oldest fee, since that is when the office first
 * became owed money on it.
