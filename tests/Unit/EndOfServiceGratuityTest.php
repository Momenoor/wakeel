 * End-of-service gratuity, Federal Decree-Law 33/2021 Article 51.
 *
 * The figures below are all computed on BASIC salary at a thirty-day month,
 * because that is what the statute says and because getting it wrong is
 * expensive in exactly one direction: paying gratuity on gross would overstate
 * the liability by whatever housing and transport come to, which in this office
 * is a large fraction of the package.
 *
 * Dates drive every calculation here (not raw day counts) because a part-year
 * is priced by real calendar months and the real length of whichever month it
 * lands in — a day-count-only API cannot express that.
